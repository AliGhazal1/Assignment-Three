                    As a Summer Camp Assistant, I had to take care of kids between the age of 4-12. I had to make sure they were all there at all times, I had to ensure activities for them for all the places we went to, and I made sure to provide a safe and fun space for them.

                    As a Security Card at the Calgary Court Center, I have to ensure clients get to the place they desire, ensure the building is safe at all times, and I conduct patrols. I also had to face many problems, which helped me develop my problem-solving skills.

            Hello. This is Ali Ghazal coming from company X-⁠Y-⁠Z. And today I will be talking about one of my skills and what my job experience consists of. And I currently work at Paladin Security as a security officer at the Calgary Court Center.
            On top of that, I had Southland Leisure Center experience as a summer camp assistance. And also I have done a couple of web designing projects for clients. And my top skills are problem solving. I've been solving problems ever since I was, like, 10 or 12.  
            I helped my dad fix many stuff and I also gained knowledge through that with a variety of items. And I have great organizational skills. I keep it in my notebook and yeah, I hope to hear from you soon and thank you very much for this opportunity. 
            Bye.
          </p>
